            Houses at Hogwarts were both the living and learning communities for
            its students. Each year's group of students in the same House shares
            the same dormitory and many classes. The houses compete throughout
            the school year, by earning and losing points for behaviour. The
            House with the most points wins the House Cup. Each House also has
            its own Quidditch team that competes for the Inter-House Quidditch
            Cup. These two competitions breed rivalries between the Houses, the
            greatest of which is that between Gryffindor and Slytherin.

          <p>
            In the early days of Hogwarts, the four founders handpicked students
            for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would be
            selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and
            each "put some brains" in it, creating the Sorting Hat to choose
            future students for each House. At the beginning of each school
            year, the magical Sorting Hat is placed on each new student's head
            during the Sorting ceremony.
